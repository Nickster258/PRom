## PRom

This is a plugin based on the idea that ROMs in computational redstone are **disgusting**. At least, such is my opinion.

This aims at remedying that by handling the ROM entirely. That is, creating, editing, and programing the ROM.

Much of this is still being theorized. This project is very much a _WIP_.
